We have some exciting news! First, <a href="http://www.couchbase.com">Couchbase</a> the company behind <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">couchdb</a> published a <a href="http://www.couchbase.com/case-studies/incandescent">case study</a> about the <a href="http://menagerievet.com/">Menagerie Whiteboard</a> (Thank you Couchbase :)). Our solution is built entirely in JavaScript and HTML5 (the Couchbase guys are calling this approach <a href="http://couchapp.org/page/index">'couchapps'</a>) and it's served directly from couchdb. It means there is no need for the traditional backend. Our JavaScript code is based on the wonderful <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/">Backbone.js</a> library.

The second piece of exciting news is that we just released a new version of the whiteboard which now works on iPad (check our demo <a href="http://whiteboard.couchone.com/whiteboard/_design/whiteboard/index.html">here</a>). We redesigned the UI and changed few things around to support the iPad platform.

We plan to write more about our experience and technical challenges we encountered on the way so please stay tuned.
